# KF_Shared

The `KF_Shared` submodule plays a pivotal role in the KeysFortress ecosystem, serving as the centralized hub for managing dependency injections across various clean architecture submodules within both the KeysFortress Mobile and KeysFortress Desktop repositories.

## Purpose

In the complex landscape of KeysFortress, where clean architecture principles guide the development, `KF_Shared` acts as the bridge between different layers and components. Its primary purpose is to facilitate seamless communication and dependency resolution between the Presentation layer, Infrastructure layer, and the Main presentation layer.

## Key Features

### 1. Dependency Injection Registry

`KF_Shared` acts as a registry for dependency injections, ensuring that shared components belonging to the Presentation layer can easily access the Infrastructure layer. This abstraction simplifies the integration of shared components across both KeysFortress Mobile and KeysFortress Desktop repositories.

### 2. Reusability Across Platforms

Shared components that form a part of the Presentation layer and are reusable across both Desktop and Mobile platforms find a common ground in `KF_Shared`. This enables a consistent and uniform development experience, promoting code reusability without compromising the integrity of the clean architecture design.

### 3. Centralized Configuration

By centralizing the dependency injection configuration, `KF_Shared` reduces redundancy and ensures a single source of truth for dependencies. This enhances maintainability, as any changes or updates to dependencies can be managed efficiently within this submodule.
